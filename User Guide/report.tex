\section{Introduction}
Good circuit design is more than simply calculating the “correct” component values, it is ensuring that the circuit behaves properly when it has been manufactured in large quantities! Part of that evaluation is ensuring that the circuit performs adequately within the bounds of production tolerances. Student projects, by their nature, are often one-off designs, and students have the ability to adjust component values to account for outputs that are not quite what was expected. In a production setting, this is not a feasible strategy.

This project will produce a front-end for the Spice circuit simulator that supports the testing of designs across the range of possible production values of components. The input to the simulator will be a Spice simulation file (previously tested using a package such as LTSpice), and a set of component tolerances. The project will then proceed to run the simulation multiple times, for the different component tolerances, to test out the impact of these on the final output.

\section{Installation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Requirement}\par
    ngspice = 34\par
    python3\par
    Module: numpy, scipy, PyQt5 $\geqslant$ 5.15, matplotlib, pandas, django, quantiphy\par
    Optional Module: bs4, weasyprint, coloredlogs\par

    \item  \textbf{Ngspice Configuration}\par
    Ngspice should be installed in directory \textit{./Workspace}. This project has included a pre-compiled ngspice. If anything wrong is with it, you can compile it by yourself. It can be downloaded from \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/}{sourceforge ngspice Git page}.

    To compile ngspice34, make sure you enable the relative paths for spinit and code models.
    \lstset{backgroundcolor=\color{white},numbers=none,keepspaces=false}
    \begin{lstlisting}
    $ ./configure --enable-relpath
    \end{lstlisting}

    The normal compile command for linux-64 bit installed is
    \begin{lstlisting}{language=bash}
    $ sudo apt install libxaw7-dev autoconf automake libtool libreadline6-dev
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ mkdir release
    $ cd release
    $ ../configure --with-x --enable-xspice --enable-cider --with-readline=yes --enable-openmp --enable-relpath --prefix={Path-To-Workspace} --disable-debug CFLAGS="-m64 -O2" LDFLAGS="-m64 -s"
    $ make clean
    $ make install
    \end{lstlisting}
    Where Path-To-Workspace is the complete path to the dirctory \textit{Workspace}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project structure}
This project is mainly written in python3 and for circuit analysis part, it is written in spice language.

\subsection{main.py}

\noindent\textbf{Variable Description}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{root}: Root path of main.python3
    \item \textcolor{blue}{path}: PATH variable of the system
    \item \textcolor{blue}{spiceinit}: See Function \hyperlink{init}{init()} in Logging.py for more information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{src/read.py}
Read in a circuit file

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textcolor{blue}{rm(*filename)}\\
        Delete the given files. If the file does not exist, pass.

    \item Class \textcolor{blue}{C}\\
        Capacitor.\\
        \textbf{Attribute:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{C.name}: Capacitor name
            \item \textcolor{blue}{C.c}: Capacitance value
            \item \textcolor{blue}{C.tol}: Capacitor tolerance
        \end{itemize}

    \item Class \textcolor{blue}{R}\\
        Capacitor.\\
        \textbf{Attribute:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{R.name}: Resistor name
            \item \textcolor{blue}{R.r}: Resistance value
            \item \textcolor{blue}{R.tol}: Resistor tolerance
        \end{itemize}

    \item Class \textcolor{blue}{circuit}\\
        Circuit class.\\
        \textbf{Attribute:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Initialize\\
                Give the file name of the netlist file. For example, circuit(TIA.cir)

            \item \textcolor{blue}{circuit.read()}\\
                Read in the netlist and create two circuit files, \textit{test.cir} and \textit{run.cir}.

                Acceptable control command in netlist: ".model", ".subckt", ".global", ".include", ".lib", ".temp", ".ends", ".ac", ".probe"

                \textbf{Caution:} All commands between \textbf{.control} and \textbf{.endc} will be ignored.

                To run simulation correctly, the netlist must have a net named \textbf{"out"}!

            \item \textcolor{blue}{circuit.init()}\\
                Initialize the circuit, check if any error in circuit file.

                It will call the ngspice to first perform an operating point analysis. During this process, it will give us all the component and net information. The first perform output data is stored in file \textit{'op'} abd \textit{'list'}.

                If the operation point analysis is passed, it will perform an AC, small-signal frequency response
                analysis and the output data is stored in file \textit{'ac'}.

                Finally, it will read the information of the resistors and capacitors in the circuit from file 'list', generated during the first test. The components in the subcircuit will not be read.

                \textbf{Return:} two-element tuple (error\textunderscore message, flag).

                flag=0: no error occurs or uncategorized error

                flag=1: include file error. Could not find include file

                flag=2: Unknown subcircuit error.

                repl: String, Required. Uploaded include file\\

\section{GUI Guide}
\subsection{Main Window}
The interface of the main window is shown in figure \ref{Main}.

The addtimetext line is enabled if the analysis is not step mode or Op amp mode.
